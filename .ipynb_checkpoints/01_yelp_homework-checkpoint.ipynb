    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment uses a small subset of the data from Kaggle's [Yelp Business Rating Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013) competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of the data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`yelp.csv`** contains the dataset. It is stored in the course repository (in the **`data`** directory), so there is no need to download anything from the Kaggle website.\n",
    "- Each observation (row) in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.\n",
    "- The **stars** column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review.\n",
    "- The **text** column is the text of the review.\n",
    "- The **cool** column is the number of \"cool\" votes this review received from other Yelp users. All reviews start with 0 \"cool\" votes, and there is no limit to how many \"cool\" votes a review can receive. In other words, it is a rating of the review itself, not a rating of the business.\n",
    "- The **useful** and **funny** columns are similar to the **cool** column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Predict the star rating of a review using **only** the review text. (We will not be using the cool, funny, or useful columns.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** After each task, I recommend that you check the shape and the contents of your objects, to confirm that they match your expectations."
